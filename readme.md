# Corona Pop!
## How to play
You are a white blood cell in the body, use your mouse to control the position.

There are blue healthy cells that you will need to avoid touching otherwise they will pop! If you do pop a blue healthy cell your white cell will get bigger making it harder to navigate the blood.
If blue cells are popped they will slowly regenerate, the body can repair after all!

There is a health bar down the bottom of the screen that is directly linked to the number of blue
healthy cells. If you loose too many blue healthy cells you will die.

There will be red virus cells that appear periodically that you will need to eliminate. If a virus cell comes into contact with a blue healthy cell it will corrupt it and turn it into a virus cell.

The aim of the game is to last as long as you can. There is a time down the bottom right to keep track of your progress.

## Compatiblity
I can only guarantee compatibility with an up to date Chrome or Firefox browser.

This game is not designed for mobile. It will require at the very least a trackpad or more ideally a mouse.

## Polishing
This game is not polished. It would be great to have the size of the game adapt to screen size, have a 'how to play' built in and all the features you are used to. But all this takes time and it's just a bit of fun! If you would like to implement these features be my guest, I'll accept working pull requests :)

## Why?
I wanted to use the P5 javascript library. It is a fantastic library that makes drawing and animating considerably easier (if only I knew this when I did my connect four game!). I started this as 'Bubble Pop' but then this pandemic hit and I saw the oportunity to make it more relevant!
