# Corona Pop!
## How to play
### White cells
You are a white blood cell in the body, use your mouse to control the position.

### Blue cells
There are blue healthy cells that you will need to avoid touching otherwise they will pop! If you do pop a blue healthy cell your white cell will slowly get bigger making it harder to navigate.
If blue cells are popped they will slowly regenerate, the body can repair itself after all!

### Health Bar
There is a health bar down the bottom of the screen that is directly linked to the number of blue
healthy cells. If you loose too many blue healthy cells you will die.

### Red and other cells
There will be red virus cells that appear periodically that you will need to eliminate. If a virus cell comes into contact with a blue healthy cell it will corrupt it and turn it into a virus cell.
There are two other cells that will show up throughout the game, but their behavior is unknown.

### Slow cells
If you press spacebar you can temporarily freeze healthy cells in place to give yourself time to fight off viruses. You only get three of these freezes. On the bottom right of the screen there are three white marks keeping track of how many freezes you have left.

### Aim
The aim of the game is to last as long as you can. There is a time down the bottom right to keep track of your progress.

## Compatiblity
I can only guarantee compatibility with an up to date Chrome or Firefox browser.

This game is not designed for mobile. It will require at the very least a trackpad or more ideally a mouse and a spacebar.

## Polishing
This game is not polished. It would be great to have the size of the game adapt to screen size, have a 'how to play' built in and all the features you are used to. But all this takes time and it's just a bit of fun! If you would like to implement these features be my guest, I'll accept working pull requests :)

Also if you do go snooping through the code.. I eventually stopped caring about the beauty and elegance. I just wanted things working! Open source is stressfull times. Once again open to pull requests!

## Why?
I wanted to use the P5 javascript library. It is a fantastic library that makes drawing and animating considerably easier (if only I knew this when I did my connect four game!). I started this as 'Bubble Pop' but then this pandemic hit and I saw the oportunity to make it more relevant!
