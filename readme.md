# Corona Pop!
## How to play
You are a white blood cell in the body, use your mouse to control the position.

There are blue healthy cells that you will need to avoid touching otherwise they will pop! If you do pop a blue healthy cell your white cell will get bigger making it harder to navigate the blood.
If blue cells are popped they will slowly regenerate, the body can repair after all!

There is a health bar down the bottom of the screen that is directly linked to the number of blue
healthy cells. If you loose too many blue healthy cells you will die.

There will be red virus cells that appear periodically that you will need to eliminate. If a virus cell comes into contact with a blue healthy cell it will corrupt it and turn it into a virus cell.

The aim of the game is to last as long as you can. There is a time down the bottom right to keep track of your progress.

## Compatiblity
I can only guarantee compatibility with an up to date Chrome or Firefox browser. Maybe others work but I won't be checking.

This game is not designed for mobile at all. It will require at the very least a trackpad or more ideally a mouse.
