# Corona Pop!
## How to play
Navigate to https://frasersab.github.io/CoronaPop/ to play!

### White cells
You are a white blood cell in the body, use your mouse to control the position.

### Blue cells
There are blue healthy cells that you will need to avoid touching otherwise they will pop! If you do pop a blue healthy cell your white cell will slowly get bigger making it harder to navigate.
If blue cells are popped they will slowly regenerate, the body can repair itself after all!

### Health Bar
There is a health bar down the bottom of the screen that is directly linked to the number of blue
healthy cells. If you loose too many blue healthy cells you will die.

### Red and other cells
There will be red virus cells that appear periodically that you will need to eliminate. If a red virus cell comes into contact with a blue healthy cell it will corrupt it and turn it into a virus cell. There are two other cells that will show up throughout the game, but their behavior is unknown.

### Freeze cells
If you press spacebar you can temporarily freeze healthy cells in place to give yourself time to fight off viruses. You only get three of these freezes. To the right of the health bar there are three white marks keeping track of how many freezes you have left.

### Aim
The aim of the game is to last as long as you can. There is a time down the bottom right to keep track of your progress.

## Compatiblity
At the time of making this was compatible with a Chrome or Firefox browser. It is not actively supported so I apologise if it is not working for you, the web changes rather fast!

This game is not designed for mobile. It will require at the very least a trackpad or more ideally a mouse and a spacebar.

## Polishing
If I were to do it again, I would do it differently. But it's time for new projects!

## Why?
I wanted to use the P5 javascript library. It is a fantastic library that makes drawing and animating considerably easier (if only I knew about this when I did my connect four game!). I started this as 'Bubble Pop' but then this pandemic hit and I saw the oportunity to make it more relevant!
